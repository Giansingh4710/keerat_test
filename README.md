[Keerat. To provide for you Sikh Listening needs](https://giansingh4710.github.io/keerat/)

I have made many websites that have audios of different things having to do with the sikh faith. This website is basically a collection of all of those
websites and more packaged into one. So if you wanna listen to scripture readings to singing(keertan) to discourse(katha). This site has it. Open to
any suggestions on things to add or anything
